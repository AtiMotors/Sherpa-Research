The step by step installation of ROS2 environment is demonstrated below. 

You can also refer to the official documentation of ROS2 for the setup on Ubuntu 22.04 
at https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html

# Step 1 : Open the following link 
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html

# Step 2 : Select "deb packages" under "Ubuntu Linux - Jammy Jellyfish (22.04)" or just click the below link
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html

# Step 3 : Open a fresh terminal on your desktop. 

# Step 4 : Set locale
Make sure you have a locale which supports UTF-8. If you are in a minimal environment (such as a docker container), the locale 
may be something minimal like POSIX. We test with the following settings. However, it should be fine if youâ€™re using a different 
UTF-8 supported locale.

Run the following commands in the terminal

locale  # check for UTF-8
sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
locale  # verify settings

# Step 5 : Setup Sources
You will need to add the ROS 2 apt repository to your system.
First ensure that the Ubuntu Universe repository is enabled.

Run the following commands on a freshly opened terminal on your system :

sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe

# Step 6 : Now add the ROS 2 GPG key with apt.

sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

Then add the repository to your sources list.
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] 
http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d
/ros2.list > /dev/null

# Step 7 : Install ROS 2 packages
Update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories.

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
