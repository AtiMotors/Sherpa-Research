## **About Sherpa Research**
Conducting cutting edge research on autonomous robots and autonomous vehicles in a safe and sustained manner is the need of the hour, especially in research domains like multi robot navigation. The current research robots in the market are not as modular as expected for researchers, and most of them operate only indoors. Sherpa Reaserach aims to provide the most modular drive-by-wire Indoor / Outdoor AMR for academic research and R&D , wherein we provide complete flexibility for researchers to integrate compute, sensors, and actuators of your choice.
