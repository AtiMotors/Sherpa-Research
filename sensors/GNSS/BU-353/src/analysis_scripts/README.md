# Analysis Scripts to study the data collected

## Stationary Data Analysis : 

I have managed to write a small script to estimate two types of errors in the stationary GPS data (through northing and easting data) 

To run the code, please follow the steps : 

cd /LAB1/src/analysis_scripts

python3 stationary_data_analysis.py

You should get the following outputs : 

1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the mean of absolute differences of values, with a known reference or a target value 

2. Root Mean Square Error is the root of average of squared differences, with a known reference or a target value
